# Drug-Trial-Classification-Model
 Drug Trial Classification Model
Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts drug trial outcomes using patient demographics and drug-related attributes. It focuses on efficient clinical trial analysis through data preprocessing, visualization, and classification models.

Features
Data preprocessing with imputation, scaling, and encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for trends and relationships.
Implementation of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM.
Model evaluation using metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter optimization with Grid Search.
Dataset Description
Key Features:

Patient Demographics: Age, gender, race.
Drug Information: Type, dosage.
Trial Outcomes: Success or failure.
Preprocessing Steps:

Missing values imputed using mean (numerical) and mode (categorical).
Continuous features scaled using Min-Max Scaling.
Categorical variables encoded with One-Hot and Label Encoding.
Approach
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, scaled numerical features, and encoded categorical data.
EDA: Visualized data distributions and correlations.
Model Development: Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM models.
Optimization: Performed Grid Search to fine-tune hyperparameters.
