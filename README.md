# Drug Trial Classification Model

## Project Overview
This machine learning project predicts drug trial outcomes based on patient demographics and drug-related attributes. The goal is to enhance clinical trial analysis through effective data preprocessing, visualization, and classification models.

---

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Imputation, scaling, and encoding of data to handle missing values and normalize features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identification of trends, correlations, and insights in the data.
- **Model Development**: Implementation of:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Grid Search for fine-tuning model parameters.

---

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains:
- **Patient Demographics**: Age, gender, race.
- **Drug Information**: Type, dosage.
- **Trial Outcomes**: Success or failure.

---

## Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Missing Value Handling**:
   - Numerical: Imputed using the mean.
   - Categorical: Imputed using the mode.
2. **Feature Scaling**: Applied Min-Max Scaling to continuous features.
3. **Categorical Encoding**:
   - One-Hot Encoding for nominal variables.
   - Label Encoding for ordinal variables.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized data distributions and correlations.

---

## Approach
1. Preprocess the dataset using the `preprocess.py` script.
2. Train models using `train_model.py`.
3. Evaluate the results with the `evaluate_model.py` script.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` for data visualization
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning

---

## Results
- **Model Performance**:
  - Accuracy: 0.20
  - Precision: 0.20
  - Recall: 0.20
  - F1-Score: 0.20
(These metrics indicate the need for further optimization or data improvements.)

---

## Future Scope
- Incorporate domain-specific features and external datasets for better predictions.
- Explore advanced algorithms like neural networks for improved accuracy.
- Develop APIs for real-time deployment in clinical research.
